# Jeff's Genomics Toolkit
Scripts I write for working with sequencing data. Mostly BASH and python (3, don't use python 2 anymore, please).

This repo is really for archive of general-purpose scripts rather than being intended for redistribution.They "should" work, at least for the specific use-case I needed at the time.
