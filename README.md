# genomics_tools
Scripts I write or find useful for working with sequencing data.
Mostly BASH and python, but a few other things as well.
They "should" work, at least for the specific use-case I needed at the time.
This repo is really for archive of general-purpose scripts rather than being intended for redistribution.
